    <!-- Description -->
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna, also known as lasagne, is a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types, made in very wide, flat sheets. 
        The same-named Italian dish is made of stacked layers of lasagna alternating with fillings such as ragù (ground meats 
        and tomato sauce), béchamel sauce, vegetables, cheeses (which may include ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan), and seasonings 
        and spices. The dish may be topped with grated cheese, which becomes melted during baking. Typically cooked pasta is 
        assembled with the other ingredients and then baked in an oven. The resulting baked pasta is cut into single-serving square 
        or rectangular portions.</p>

    <!-- Steps for making the recipe -->
    <h2>Steps</h2>

        <h3>Prep Work</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>,<b>Combine the cheese filling ingredients</b> in a medium bowl and set aside. Measure out remaining ingredients.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Make the Meat Sauce</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Heat olive oil</b> over medium heat and <b>add the diced onions.</b> Let them soften for 10 minutes. 
                (This allows them to release a little sugar which is a nice offset to the acidity of the tomatoes.)</li>
            <li><b>Add the ground beef and sausage</b> and increase heat to medium-high. Use a spatula to break up the meat so that 
                it’s very fine and crumbled. Cook for 8-10 minutes, or until cooked through. <b>Add garlic</b> during the last minute. 
                Drain excess grease.</li>
            <li><b>Add the chicken broth</b> and use a silicone spatula to “clean” the bottom and sides of the pot. <b>Add the marinara sauce, tomato 
                paste, hot sauce, and Worcestershire sauce.</b> Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cover partially and let the sauce 
                simmer gently while you boil the pasta noodles.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Preheat Oven and Cook the Lasagna Noodles</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to <b>375°.</b></li>
            <li><b>Begin boiling a large pot of salted pasta water</b> for the lasagna noodles. Once a rapid boil is reached, <b>cook the noodles to 
                al dente</b> according to package instructions. (Set a timer to ensure you don’t overcook them.) Gently stir with a wooden 
                spoon throughout cooking to prevent the noodles from sticking. <b>Drain and rinse with cold water</b> until noodles are 
                completely cool.</li>
            <li>Lay the cooled noodles flat on wax or parchment paper while you begin assembling the lasagna.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Assemble</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Spread 1 heaping cup of meat sauce</b> on the bottom of a 9 x 13-inch casserole dish. 
                Next, <b>add 4 lasagna noodles</b>, overlapping them if needed.</li>
            <li><b>Spread 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture</b> over the noodles, followed by about <b>1 ½ cups of meat sauce.</b></li>
            <li>Top with <b>4 more lasagna noodles, 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture, 1 ½ cups meat sauce.</b></li>
            <li>Finish with <b>4 more lasagna noodles, the rest of the ricotta mixture,</b> and <b>the rest of the meat sauce.</b></li>
            <li><b>Top with 2 ½ cups of Mozzarella cheese.</b></li>
            <li><b>Spray foil with nonstick cooking spray</b> and place it spray-side-down on top of the baking dish to prevent the cheese 
                from sticking to it.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Bake</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Bake for 35 minutes.</b> Remove cover and <b>bake for 10 more minutes.</b></li>
            <li>Remove and garnish with fresh parsley. <b>Let it sit for 15 minutes prior to serving</b> to allow the layers to set. 
                Serve with garlic bread with cheese.</li>
        </ol>
